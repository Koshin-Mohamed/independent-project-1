      <p>
        Hi! My name is Koshin Mohamed, I'm 33 years old. I'm originally from
        Somalia but was raised and grew up in Toronto, Canada. I graduated from
        Ryerson University with a Bachelor in Commerce and from Seneca College
        with a Certificate in Global Logistics and Supply Chain Management for
        my post grad.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work experience in mainly in the family business which is transport
        and wholesale of oil products. I have been and still am the Operations
        Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always wanted to learn programming and have even tried on my own
        but quickly realized I needed more structure and help. This is why I
        decided to take a class at Moringa School. In addition, i'm quite
        entrepreneurial and have many ideas that I want to execute that willl
        require a website or app. For that reason, I want to be able to code and
        test it myslef to see if it is viable before investing in it. Lastly,
        this is the direction the world is going today, technology is touching
        almost every aspect of our lives and I don't want to get left behind.
        Plus it's fun to create things!
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my interests and hobbies include but are not limited to: playing
        and watching a variety of sports, working out, watching tv shows and
        movies, spending times with family, travelling, and building businesses.
