    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      I've always wanted to learn programming and have even tried on my own but
      quickly realized I needed more structure and help. This is why I decided
      to take a class at Moringa School. In addition, i'm quite entrepreneurial
      and have many ideas that I want to execute that willl require a website or
      app. For that reason, I want to be able to code and test it myslef to see
      if it is viable before investing in it. Lastly, this is the direction the
      world is going today, technology is touching almost every aspect of our
      lives and I don't want to get left behind. Plus it's fun to create things!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my interests and hobbies include but are not limited to: playing
      and watching a variety of sports, working out, watching tv shows and
      movies, spending times with family, travelling, and building businesses.
